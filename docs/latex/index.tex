This project corresponds to part 1 of the project done in the course Desenho de Algoritmos, a 2nd year course in the B\+Sc/\+First Degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering @ F\+E\+UP\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Project Motivation}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
In this first programming project assignment, we were asked to implement an analysis tool that can support the management team of a railway network to make informed decisions about how to best allocate its resources, both financial as well as physical (e.\+g., trains). This tool, which will use a realistic data set, will allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign selected trains to lines, how to maximize its revenue when multiple levels of service are offered, or even, identify more sensitive sections of its network to failures so as to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Authors}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
