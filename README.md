# DA Railway Network

This project corresponds to part 1 of the project done in the course Desenho de Algoritmos, a 2nd year course in the BSc/First Degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering @ FEUP

## Project Motivation

In this first programming project assignment, we were asked to implement an analysis tool that can support
the management team of a railway network to make informed decisions about how to best allocate its
resources, both financial as well as physical (e.g., trains). This tool, which will use a realistic data set, will
allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign selected trains to lines, how to maximize
its revenue when multiple levels of service are offered, or even, identify more sensitive sections of its
network to failures so as to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.
